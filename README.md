# TestAround

This was created to demo 2 different components accessing that same data stored in a service. I'm not planning on extending it as it is really
just for a code demo. Feel free to fork or clone it if it will help you teach someone else or use in your own app. 

# Usage Instructions

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

### Note
Before running ng serve for the first time please run `npm install` to make sure you have everything.
There arent any external libraries but I have found that it runs smoother if you do that.

## Development server



Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
